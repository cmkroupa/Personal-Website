                                Designed and implemented a platform utilizing StarkNet's blockchain technology to enable users to create a "group fund", which other people could then donate to.
                                The power of the group fund was in a democratic decision-making process where when the owner of the fund wanted to withdrawal, the withdrawal is only processed when majority of the fund members approve, addressing mistrust in collaborative funding systems and ensuring accountability.

                                Utilized proficient Java coding language knowledge to create a movement strategy game for a frog, navigating through pond cells while avoiding alligators and hazardous mud.
                                The frog must reach his mate by making decisions based on cell types, including lily pads, reeds, and mud, which influence his movement and safety.
                                Developed a preference-based decision making system using a priority queue to determine optimal sequence of moves based on environmental factors.
